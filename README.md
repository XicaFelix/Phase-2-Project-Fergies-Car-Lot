# Fergie's Car Dealership

## What is This Project About?

Fergie's Car Dealership is a single page application built using React and Javascript, with React-Bootstrap for styling. This application is meant to replicate an app a car dealer could log-in to and modify the dealership's inventory. 

The 'car dealer' can log-in to the app and then see all of the cars currently listed in their inventory. They have the ability to edit a specific car by clicking on that car's edit button. Then, they are presented with a screen pre-filled with the current details for that car, which they can edit, and submit. Submitting their changes updates the json-server and re-renders the home page with the updated car inventory and details.
